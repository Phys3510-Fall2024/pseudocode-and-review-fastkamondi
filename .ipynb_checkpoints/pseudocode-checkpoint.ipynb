    "## Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Pseudocode?\n",
    "Pseudocode is a simplified and structured way to represent algorithms or solutions to problems without relying on the specific syntax of any programming language. It uses plain language and a logical structure to outline the steps in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Pseudocode?\n",
    "1. **Organizing your thoughts/strategy** By thinking through the steps of a solution, you'll fine-tune your approach.\n",
    "2. **Language Independence:** Pseudocode focuses on the *logic* of the algorithm rather than implementation details, making it accessible regardless of the programming language.\n",
    "3. **Problem Decomposition:** It breaks a problem into smaller, manageable parts before coding, aiding in planning and understanding.\n",
    "4. **Collaborative Understanding:** Since pseudocode is language-agnostic, it can be easily understood by both programmers and non-programmers.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Example: Motion in a 2D Anharmonic Oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:**  \n",
    "Simulate the motion of a particle in a 2D anharmonic oscillator potential:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}k(x^2 + y^2) + \\alpha (x^4 + y^4)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\(k\\) is the harmonic constant and $\\alpha$ is the anharmonic constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example pseudocode for this problem:\n",
    "1. **Define constants**: Harmonic constant ($k$), anharmonic constant ($\\alpha$), mass ($m$), and time step ($\\Delta t$).\n",
    "2. **Initialize variables**:\n",
    "   - Initial position ($x_0, y_0$).\n",
    "   - Initial velocity ($v_{x0}, v_{y0}$).\n",
    "3. **Set up a first-order system of equations** to feed into a differential equation solver:\n",
    "   - Compute the force components using derivatives of the potential:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     F_x = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}, \\quad F_y = -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - Define a function which takes in positions and velocities and outputs their time derivatives.\n",
    "4. **Use a differential equation solver** to integrate the system over time:\n",
    "   - Pass the function and initial conditions to the solver.\n",
    "5. **Extract the results**:\n",
    "   - Retrieve positions ($x, y$) at each time step.\n",
    "6. **Plot the traje\n",
    "7. ctory** of the particle in the 2D plane.\n",
    "8. **Explore physics and test code** by adjusting parameters. (e.g. for $\\alpha=0$ we have an analytical solution for comparison, which we could plot alongside the numerical results to evaluate accuracy. We could also superimpose the trajectories on a contour plot of the potential energy to test our understanding.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "1. The pseudocode above is **independent of programming language**. You could implement it in Python, C++, Java, or any other language with minor modifications.\n",
    "2. By focusing on the *logic* of the algorithm, pseudocode ensures that the solution is robust and adaptable to any programming environment.\n",
    "3. Translating this pseudocode into Python or any other language would involve writing loops, handling arrays, and using basic arithmetic operations.\n",
